# Welcome to Alara

Alara is a fantasy setting built around principles of radical queer inclusion. Important characters in Alara's history are trans, nonbinary, gay, pansexual, otherkin, etc. Alara is a world on the brink, caught in a war of ideologies as the fascist forces of Hadrax the Destroyer are starting to encroach upon the socialist Kalvos Union and the capitalist Grand Ostaran Republic.
